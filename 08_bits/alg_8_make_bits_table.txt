I need a new python file that:
- read ./data/CERN-01_event1221_nbit8.csv
- read ./data/CERN-02_sec1221_nbit8.csv
- convert each line of the files into single digits
- add correspondin digits of the first line of the first csv file to each line of the second csv line in the follwing way:
    - Each digit must be added to the corresponding one in binary without carrying it to the next digit.
- at the end I need a csv file of one column.
